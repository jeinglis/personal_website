                <p>Growing up in a family of medical professionals I had always planned on attending medical school. This plan landed me in Halifax pursuing a Neuroscience degree at Dalhousie University during which I realized I enjoyed problem solving but not necessarily the field of Medicine.
                    Following the completion of my neuro degree I returned to Lethbridge where I worked as a bartender while I planned my next move. I soon found myself enrolled in Engineering at the University of Calgary. Originally planning to enter the Electrical Engineering department to complement my previous education.
                    I found that I enjoyed my software classes far more than any of the others and decided to pursue software engineering instead. In 2016, following my third year of Eng, I obtained a 16 month internship with Transcanada Pipelines Ltd. which I enjoyed emmensely and not only further developed my software design, documentaion
                    and development skills but I also learned the complexities of working in a large corporation. During my internship I got married to my best friend whom I lured to Alberta from Halifax. I am currently finishing my final year of engineering.
                    and I couldn't be more excited to start the next chapter.  </p>
